## Implementation Steps
This section explains the step-by-step process of implementing a fraud detection system, emphasizing real-time anomaly detection and classification methods.
### 1. Data Collection
#### Objective: 
 - Stream real-time transactional data for analysis.
#### Explanation: 
 - Integrate with transactional systems to collect data on transactions, user behaviors, and other related events in real-time.
#### Tools:
 - AWS Kinesis: Capture and process real-time data streams.
 - Google Pub/Sub: Reliable messaging for real-time data ingestion.
### 2. Data Storage
#### Objective: 
 - Store transactional data in a structured format for analysis.
#### Explanation: 
 - Maintain data in relational databases to enable batch processing and efficient querying.
#### Tools:
 - AWS RDS: Scalable relational database service.
 - Google Cloud SQL: Managed database for structured data.
 - Azure SQL Database: Fully managed relational database solution.
### 3. Feature Engineering
#### Objective: 
 - Create meaningful features to enhance model performance.
#### Explanation: 
- Extract key attributes such as transaction frequency, amounts, geographic locations, and user behaviors to capture patterns indicative of fraud.
#### Tools:
 - Scikit-learn: Python library for preprocessing and feature extraction.
 - Featuretools: Automates feature engineering for structured data.
### 4. Model Training
#### Objective: 
 - Develop models to detect anomalies and classify transactions.
#### Explanation: Train models using labeled datasets to identify fraudulent activities:
 - Anomaly Detection: Models like Isolation Forest and Autoencoders to detect outliers.
 - Classification: Models like Decision Trees or Random Forest for binary classification of transactions.

#### Tools:
 - TensorFlow: Build deep learning-based detection models.
 - SageMaker: Train and deploy machine learning models on AWS.
 - Azure ML: Simplify model development and deployment.
### 5. Real-Time Detection
#### Objective: 
- Implement systems for real-time anomaly detection and alerting.
#### 	Explanation: 
 - Deploy trained models to analyze incoming data streams and identify suspicious activities instantly.
#### Tools:
-	AWS Lambda: Run serverless functions for real-time data analysis.
-	Azure Stream Analytics: Process real-time data streams for anomaly detection.
## Key Algorithms
#### 1.	Anomaly Detection:
-	Isolation Forest: Identifies anomalies by isolating data points in a feature space.
-	DBSCAN: Detects clusters and outliers in data.
#### 2.	Classification:
-	Random Forest: Classifies transactions by analyzing decision trees.
-	Support Vector Machines (SVM): Classifies data by finding optimal hyperplanes.
